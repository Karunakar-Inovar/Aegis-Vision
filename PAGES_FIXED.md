# Pages Fixed - Incidents, Analytics, and Admin

## Issue Resolution Summary

The issue was that the **IncidentsPage**, **AnalyticsPage**, and **AdminPage** components were missing from the codebase, even though they were referenced in the routing system and sidebar navigation.

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ 1. Created Missing Components

#### **IncidentsPage** (`/src/components/IncidentsPage.tsx`)
- **Features**: Complete incident management system
- **Functionality**: 
  - Incident listing with filtering (All, Unresolved, Resolved, Reports)
  - Search and filter capabilities
  - Statistics dashboard with metrics
  - Incident table with severity levels, status, and assignee tracking
  - Action buttons for viewing, downloading, and deleting incidents
  - Pagination support

#### **AnalyticsPage** (`/src/components/AnalyticsPage.tsx`)
- **Features**: Comprehensive analytics dashboard
- **Functionality**:
  - Overview tab with key performance indicators
  - System health metrics with real-time monitoring
  - Defect analysis with distribution charts
  - Performance analytics with visual representations
  - Time period selection (7d, 30d, 90d, 1y, custom)
  - Export functionality for reports

#### **AdminPage** (`/src/components/AdminPage.tsx`)
- **Features**: Complete administrative interface
- **Functionality**:
  - User management with role-based access control
  - System settings configuration
  - User roles and permissions management
  - Recent activity tracking
  - Security settings (2FA, password rotation, session timeout)
  - System information display
  - Storage and logs management placeholders

### ✅ 2. Updated Routing System

#### **AppRouter** (`/src/AppRouter.tsx`)
- Added missing routes for all three pages:
  ```typescript
  <Route path="/incidents" element={<IncidentsPage />} />
  <Route path="/analytics" element={<AnalyticsPage />} />
  <Route path="/admin" element={<AdminPage />} />
  <Route path="/annotation" element={<Annotation />} />
  ```

#### **Sidebar Navigation** (`/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`)
- Added Annotation link to the navigation menu
- All navigation links now properly correspond to existing routes

## Design Consistency

### 🎨 **UI/UX Standards Maintained**
- **Dark Theme**: Consistent gray-800/gray-900 backgrounds matching existing design
- **Component Structure**: Uses MainLayout with tab-based navigation
- **Color Coding**: Professional color scheme for status indicators and severity levels
- **Typography**: Consistent font sizing and spacing
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover states, transitions, and proper button styling
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with proper grid systems

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed components with proper interfaces
- **React Hooks**: Modern state management with useState
- **Lucide Icons**: Consistent icon library usage throughout
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling matching the existing codebase
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable MainLayout pattern
